# Dragon-Real-Estate-Project-
### DRAGON REAL ESTATES 
 ### PROBLEM  TRATDOWN  

- We are given dataset of house price with some features like number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms etc.
 - our task is to create a model which will predict the price of any new house by looking at the features .
 - While learning about machine learning it is the best to actually work with real-world data , No just artificial dataset .
 - There are hundreds of open datasets to choose from. ![image](https://github.com/shwet369/Dragon-Real-Estate-Project-/assets/136867631/7be7598d-94ab-4485-b3db-46da2a1f4e09)

 
 
 ## GETTING STARTED 
 - The first Question shweta should ask Mr. joseph is what is the business objective and end goal? How will Dragon real estates benifit from the model?
 - Mr. joseph tells shweta that Dragon real estates will use this model to predict house prices in a given area and will invest in the area if its undervalued
 - Next question Shweta should ask mr. joseph is how does the current solution look like? the answer is -mannual experts who analyze the features 
 - The prediction made by so called "experts' are not very good (error rate is 25%) which is why Dragon real estates pvt ltd is counting on shweta !
 - ex. `f1--> model->price (10cr)-> in market(3cr)`

### Finding The Type Of Model  To Build
- Supervised , unsupervised, or Reinforcement Learning ?
- Classification task or Regression task?
- Batch learning or online learning techniques ?
   - online learning techniques- Data significantly data change  like G-Mail spam production problem
   - batch learning -  already data is giving  train the model and in feature retrain the model
 
  ### SELECTING A PERFORMANCE MEASURE 
- A typical performance measure for regression problem is the root mean square error (RMSE)
- RMSE is generally the preffred performance measure for regression tasks so we choose it for this perticuler problem we are solving for dragon real estates pvt ltd
- other performance measure include mean Absulate error, Manhattan norm etc. but we will use RMSE for this problem.

## CHECKING THE ASSUMPTIONS
- It is very important for shweta to check for any assumptions he might have made and correct them before launching the ml system 
- for example she should make sure that the team needs the price and not the categories like expensive, cheap etc.
- if latter is the case formulating the problem as a regression task will be counted as a big mistake 
- shweta talked to the Dragon real estate team members and ensured that he is aware of all the assumptions.
-     `Feature` - `MODEL` -   `price`
-         expensive or cheep

ALL SETS FOR CODING NOW 
- The lights are green and shweta is all sets for coding now 
- shweta will use a jupyter notebook
- The Jupyter notebook is an open -source web application that allows you to create and share documents that containts live code , equations , visualizations and narrative text.
- This will make it  easy  for shweta to documents and use the code as an a notebook.![image](https://github.com/shwet369/Dragon-Real-Estate-Project-/assets/136867631/ab3e4bb1-b3b2-4180-8fdf-bbd816968ad5)
